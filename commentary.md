In chapter 30.1 of Hyginus Fabulae, Hyginus makes the deliberate word order choice to show Hercules’ incredible ability.
In latin, Hyginus writes “...dracones duos duabus manibus…”, which within the context of the story means he killed two snakes with his own two hands. 
The way Hyginus juxtaposed duos and duabus by placing the two forms of two next to each other, enhances the story of Hercules' by highlighting how he as a baby could kill a snake with only one hand, two snakes at the same time. 
In addition, in chapter 30.3, Hyginus makes an interesting syntactical choice by introducing the Hydra, then detailing her terrible effects. 
By trailing off the story and writing tantam uim ueneni, or great force of venom, it sets up the story for later on in the book when the story of the death of Hercules comes. 
Hyginus makes the deliberate choice to foreshadow so it is easy to recall and understand the death of Hercules.
