C. Translation 

Deianira, wife of Hercules, the large river, whose name was Evenus, was not able to be crossed, and Nessus the centaur, who was the son of Ixion and Nubes, asked for help. 
he carried her across the river himself, he wanted to violate Deianira.
When Hercules intervened and when Deianira begged his faith he pierced Nessus with arrows.
That man, as he was dying, gave his own blood that had been taken out to Deianira, and he said that is was a love potion when he knew that the arrows of the lerneaen Hydra, soaked in poision, had great strength.
