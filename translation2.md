B. Grammatical questions

1. Identify the antecedent of cui, and its gender and number. Then explain what case cui is, and how it functions in the relative clause. (I.e., why is cui in this case?)

1. Identify the form of transire. Explain why you placed it in the clause you chose.

Suggest one or more possible translations of Faulkner’s title into Latin.

C. Translation 

Deianira, wife of Hercules, the large river, whose name was Evenus, was not able to be crossed❌, 

and Nessus the centaur❌, who was the son of Ixion and Nubes, asked for help. 

he carried her across the river himself, he wanted to violate Deianira.❌

When Hercules intervened and when Deianira implored his faith he pierced Nessus with arrows.

That man, as he was dying, gave his own blood that had been taken out to Deianira, and he said that is was a love potion when he knew that the arrows of the lerneaen Hydra, soaked in poision, had great strength.
