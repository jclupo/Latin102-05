  - Hyginus uses "admisso" and "abluit", to vividly depicts his power to let in a great river that is able to was away all the dung. It indicates Hercules' power and paints a clear narrative. In additon, Hyginus' choice to first protray the King of Thrace and his horses so terribly, then follow with Hercules had killed them, could be viewed as a dilberate choice to peak the reader's interest, then put them at ease knowing thier dead. It is effective in creating a compelling piece of writing for the reader.
